<strong>Watching TV Series Improves Your Vocabulary</strong><br>
We all need some kind of update of our vocabulary,something like a patch.
Well,TV Series improves your personality with expanding your vocabulary approach,
it gives you more appropriate words for situation.
When someone is tuning into some kind of tv series,he/she is investing time into fictional shit,
but that shit is imposing some impact on your language ,if you are watching a show that induces strong language,
swear words will pop into your daily talks no matter how you cover it up.
Basic Slangs or other shady words are reserving seats in your vocab-coster.

<strong>Watching TV series alter your Personality</strong><br>
Fake it all you want!,But you can't deny the fact that TV shows have some kind of effect on your personality,
We all act wierd after watching a series,it is the fact that what you see on daily bases acts a backend of your frontend personality.
people act like the people they admire,they adopt some of the trait and habits of the characters they like and impliment their actions in reallife whether it is pumped on fiction television.
(personally i've polished my personality with the help of these series because of characters like Gregory House , Harvey Specter and Sherlock Holmes Solitude and Sarcasm saves my ass alot)

<strong>Passive Knowledge</strong><br>
TV series are good source of passive knowledge,
TV show like HouseMD will add some medical words to your vocab and may induce some medical knowldege in your personality which can help you
TV Series uses actual facts and knowlege with proper guidance of professionals,<br>
House MD had some actual content under the guidance of professionals from medical field.<br>
Like House MD , Silicon Valley's "D-to-F Ratio" was actual concept which was developed under the guidance of a Stanford professor .<br>
Shows Like BigBangTheory and How I Met Your Mother may induce some sarcasm to your personality!<br>
Shows like Friends may help you to push your friendship limits away.<br>
Suits can induce some knowledge of Law.<br>
Sherlock can help you to be more observant... and many more.

<strong>TV Series makes you punctual</strong><br>
We all wait for that next episode,
if you follow some tv series on tv itself you are punctual,
you are waiting for the next episode with your all senses. 
but people like me (download a season per day and watch it) are not that much punctual.
this action can make you punctual in real life,can! i am not sure about you perticularly.
