<Strong>Episode 4 : Mixing and Modding</strong><br>
There was a website named <strong>Animoto, 
A Video Animation Company,</strong>at that time they was offering a free demo video of 30 secs and at the end they present with their logo, 
I used to cut that logo and paste 2 to 3 videos to make intros and give them to the people! 
That's how I started with presentation skills<br>
Then I moved to PowerPoints, <br>
I've created some PowerPoints for my school Projects, all my presentation won prizes in school level presentations. <br>
The secret was gif images, I used alot of gif images in my presentations with the combination of Animoto videos. 
I was quite good with Gif images and custom animations in mspowerpoint <br>
I've participated in many competitions offline and online!<em>
But someone secretly made some account online for presentations on some online websites!</em>
That's how I developed my presentation skill! 
But now a days people call it bragging skills! <br>
Same Noodle Different Sauce! 
I've tried some software like Autodesk Maya, Daz3D but that was too professional to work with! <br> 
I then decided to stick to muvizu 3D and Animoto for the time! <br>
For about 2 Years, I used with them with true pleasure! <br>

Meanwhile I modded my windows 7 to make it feel like Jarvis from the iron man movie. <br>
<em>
1.I used a script named "takeownership" to get the root level access to system32 files! <br>
2.I've downloaded some modded dll files from DeviantArt <br>
3.With the help of a software named resource hacker I modified the dll to replace Microsoft logo with my logo! <br>
4.Modded my bootscreen with bootscreenchanger for Windows 7 and downloaded files from DeviantArt (you can do it too if you have windows 7)<br>
5.Downloaded authui.dll file which I further modded and put it into the system32 folder for changing the login screen of windows. <br>
6.Custom Dock<br> 
7. Software Named Rainmeter which is a framework for Desktop themes! <br>
8. Used a software named Madonna from SYN Company and mixed them all together to make it like Jarvis <br>
9.Used a custom voice provided by a company named ivona tts they provide human like sounds so I used that instead of default tts voice! <br></em>
That's how I almost created a Jarvis like AI Interface! But shit happens, I fried up my processor and damaged my CPU after heavy modification on a mediocre machine! <br>
That's how I did it! 
Actually over did it, because of my stupid mistake, I over cloaked my machine and forget to reset it to default settings! <br>
<strong>Animoto is still a good platform for making videos from images and texts! </strong><br>
