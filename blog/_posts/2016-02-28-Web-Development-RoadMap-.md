<strong> 
Web Development 
</strong> 
<br>

Web development refers to building, creating, and an maintaining websites. It includes aspects
such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.<br><br>
<i>
      Level <strong >Beginner</strong>
</i>
<br>
 <br>
<strong>
Html
</strong>
<em>
<br>HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages). HTML stands for Hyper
Text Markup Language. A markup language is a set of markup tags. HTML documents are
described by HTML tags. Each HTML tag describes different document content.
(It is the thing which is your main frame of the app )
</em>

<br>
<strong>
CSS
</strong>
<em>
<br>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
document written in a markup language.
(it is the language which is outer body of our web page,it is used to make html pages pretty)
</em>
<br>

<strong>
Javascript
</strong>
<em>
<br>JavaScript is a scripting language designed primarily for adding interactivity to Web pages and
creating Web applications.
Client­side JavaScript programs, or scripts, can be embedded directly in HTML source of Web
pages.
</em>

<strong><i>
1. HTML to define the content of web pages<br>
2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages<br>
3. JavaScript to program the behaviour of web pages</i>
</strong>
<br>
<br>
<strong>
The Road Map
</strong><br>

step 1 - <strong>CodeCademy</strong>
<br>
<em>
Codecademy is an online interactive platform that offers free coding classes in 9 different
programming languages including Python, Java, PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby, as well as markup
languages HTML a d CSS.
</em>

step 2­ - <strong> W3Schools </strong>
<br>
W3Schools is a web developers site, with tutorials and references on web development
languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and JQuery, covering most aspects of
web programming.<br>

<br>step 3 ­ - <strong>Tutorials Point </strong>
<br>
All the manual with practical examples of almost every language available ! <br>

<br>step 4-­ <strong> Torrents </strong> <br>
Yeah,Torrents! Download em all ! Free and Fun !<br><br>

<br><br>
<strong >
Bootstrap
</strong>
<br>
Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile
first projects on the web.
Twitter Bootstrap is the most popular front end framework in the recent time. It is sleek, intuitive,
and powerful mobile first front­end framework for faster and easier web development. It uses
HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
<strong>Jquery</strong><br>
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature­rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document
traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy­to­use
API that works across a multitude of browsers.<br>
<strong>Sass/Less</strong>
<br>
1 Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and
more. It’s translated to well­formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-
framework plugin.<br>
2.The dynamic stylesheet language
LESS extends CSS with dynamic behavior such as variables, mixins, operations and functions.
LESS runs on both the client­side (IE 6+, Webkit, Firefox) and server­side, with Node.js.<br>
<strong>CoffeeScript </strong><br>
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath all of those
embarrassing braces and semicolons, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous object model at its
heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.<br>
<br>

<i>Level ­<strong> PRO  </strong> </i>  <br><br>
<strong>
Object Oriented Javascript<br></strong>
Object Oriented JavaScript is designed to teach web developers how to use object oriented
programming techniques to build more efficient applications.<br>
<strong>
Angular JS </strong>
<br>
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template
language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly
and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you
would otherwise have to write.<br>
<strong>
Node JS </strong>
<br>
Node.js is an open­source, cross­platform runtime environment for developing server­side Web
applications. Although Node.js is not a JavaScript framework, many of its basic modules are
written in JavaScript, and developers can write new modules in JavaScript.<br>
<strong>
React Js
</strong>
<br>
React (sometimes styled React.js or ReactJS) is an open­source JavaScript library providing a
view for data rendered as HTML.<br>
<strong>
PHP </strong>    <br>
PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely­used open source general-
purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded
into HTML.<br>
<strong>
MySQL </strong><br>
MySQL is a freely available open source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
that uses Structured Query Language (SQL). SQL is the most popular language for adding,
accessing and managing content in a database. It is most noted for its quick processing, proven
reliability, ease and flexibility of use.<br>
<strong>
Django/Python
</strong>
<br>
Django is a high­level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean,
pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web
development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free
and open source.<br>
<strong>
MongoDB
</strong>
<br>
MongoDB is an open source, document­oriented database designed with both scalability and
developer agility in mind. Instead of storing your data in tables and rows as you would with a
relational database, in MongoDB you store JSON­like documents with dynamic schemas.
