---
<strong>Episode 1: Introduction </strong> <br>
<em>28 August 1997,New Delhi,India</em><br>

I was born to a middle class family and was introduced to computers in my early age,
i was fascinated with the thing called <strong>Desktop Computer</strong>,
i first played a game on computer,
My cousin Brother's personal computer. 
<em>
so i can say</em>,<strong>My cousins are my inspiration!</strong><br>
They taught me alphabets , i jumbled up words on my own,<br>
i started with computers while playing games,
when i used to visit my cousins, 
i observe them,i observe what they are doing and how they are doing
i memorized some of the actions like opening a folder,opening games... <br>
because they work on computers all the time,
i used to watch them doing plenty of work on computers,<br>
<em>they are kind of role model to me</em>,<br>
They introduced me to computers, <br> 
They also worked on my language skills too,
one of my cousin got married to a american girl,
I was supposed to entertain her,talk to her,play board games with her,
so that's how i started with language too,<br>
<em>All credit to my Cousins.</em><br>
after the marriage , my cousin brother gifted me his old computer,
he gave me his computer ,in a kinda hurry!
he just took a backup of his data and hand it over to me,
he was going to the united states of america,american dream!<br>
After hours of untangling ,we finally installed the computer in our home,
<br>
My first day with computer,
i turn on the computer and hold that mouse,
at that time,i just know how to play the game,that's it nothing else,
i was familiar with the pointer and double click to open the game,
i was so happy , i was having the computer in my home, 
so when too much happiness take over always some, SHIT Happens! <br>

I remember that , it was a windows xp machine ,with Â a wallpaper of the dog,classic!
so i started surfing through the data to find my favorite computer game "Kirby", 
<strong>Now that's the MOJO! </strong>
There was some adult data stored previously on that machine which was not erased,
i thought it as a game so i double clicked it ,that was some kind of adult photographs of WWF models or something,
i just closed that thing and waited for my father to leave for his office,
when i was alone in the room , i again opened it to see what is it,
i pressed the arrow key on my keyboard and trying to count how many they are,
after counting i thought ,what if dad look this thing,he will blame me ,
so i figured out how to move the folder that was just drag and drop i moved it to the desktop so i will ask my neighbour to remove that folder,
in the evening ,same day my father ,turned on the computer to copy some documents from the floppy drive ,
when he turned on the machine,he just opened the folder and almost open me up too,<br>
pow! a punch on my back , 3-4 slaps and a hard push to the wall
that's how i started with the computers.<br>
<strong>
what i learnt that time,</strong><br>
1.<em>How to Move Folders</em>
<br>
2.<em>Mild introduction to pornography
