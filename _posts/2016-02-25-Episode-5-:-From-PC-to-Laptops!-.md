title: Episode 5 - From PC to Laptops! 
---
After the first Incident,<strong>Porn vs Dad</strong>,Dad won that game... <br>
But after some time i figured it out how to access the most Broad website network!<br>
Porn Sites!!<br>
 I started with the desktop computer and opera browser. <br>
 My dad used to keep a tight check on my browsing history in the night. <br>
 With the time, I learnt about the history, cookies and cache!<br>
I learnt about the incognito and other tricks to hide the History! <br>
("This chapter was started before the tor browsing incident")!<br>
I learnt everything about the internet history thing,<br>
But one day he caught me Red-handed ,<br> No it was white handed! You know what i am talking about!<br>
He warned me and sold my desktop pc!<br>
After a long period of darkness,<br>
I demanded for the laptop,<br>
I tried each and every method,<br>
My mom agreed to gift me a laptop!<br>
But my father was not happy with the decision!<br>
After i got my laptop!<br>
He started taunting me !<br>
And blame me for the thing i did earlier!<br>
<br>
But i was devoting most of my time on studying and less on porn!<br>
So i started with learning music composition,<br>
I downloaded <strong>FL studio</strong> and <strong>VirtualDJ</strong>  and started with <strong>YouTube</strong> tutorials.<br>
I learnt the basics of both and 
Jump to the practice to get my hands dirty!<br>
<em>(Not that "dirty" dirty !)</em><br>
I practiced it for almost a month and decide to go moderate level. <br>
One day, <br>
I was checking some plugins for the Virtual dj and <br>
There was some ad showing on the right side of the page !, 
I clicked it <br>
It was some campaign featuring tiesto’s music concert offered by Acer..
I participated ,we were ordered to make a dope beat using their own sfx library !<br>
I tried my best<br>
After almost 3 months, I got my confirmation <br>
My beat was selected in the competition and i won a Acer aspire p3 ultrabook (worth 900$ at that time), 
I got my laptop before the day of Diwali(Indian festival).<br>
That beat won my dad's heart<br>
Actually that laptop won my dad's heart. <br>
Now he is happy with whatever i do with my machine! <br>
No taunting! <br>
No time limit issue! <br>

From Pc to no Pc <br>
And then<br>
No PC to 1 Notebook + 1 Ultrabook !<br>

What I’ve learnt,<br>

1.Incognito Browsing<br>
2.History,Cookies and Cache
<br>
<em>Each time you access a file through your web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc.), the browser caches (i.e., stores) it so it doesn't have to keep retrieving the same files or images from the remote web site each time you click Back or Forward. You should periodically clear the cache to allow your browser to function more efficiently.
A cookie is a file created by a web browser, at the request of a web site that is stored on a computer. These files typically store user-specific information such as selections in a form, shopping cart contents, or authentication data. Browsers will normally clear cookies that reach a certain age, but clearing them manually may solve problems with web sites or your browser.</em><br>
