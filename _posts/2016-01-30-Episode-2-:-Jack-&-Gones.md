title: Episode 2 - Jack & Gones
---
When i was 10, <br>
Love for gaming was that high on me,
i used to borrow gaming disks from my classmates,but eventually i copied all the games from my classmates had and left nothing to play with.<br>
So then me and my classmate ,
actually me derived a pattern to return the dvd's after copying it to our machines,
we used to pay once and first i copy the disc and return to the shopkeeper by saying,
the disc is not <em>working on my machine</em> <br> 
We used to do it in pattern ,
First we buy a game and after returning it 2-3 times,the other guy rent the same game and do it again and again so like this we've played almost 30 new games at that time
<em>
from midtown madness to gta liberty city stories , tekken3 to max payne all of em
</em><br>
We copied about 30 games and then the shopkeeper changed his mind. <br>
Then he started to check the game first and then hand it over to someone else
so we have nothing to do with it , our pocket money only allowed us to buy a game per month so, <br><strong>Now that's the mojo</strong> <br> 
we bought some blank discs and started to con him again, <br> 
So,in his shop we used to go and buy one game,
when he starts his computer to check the disc, one of us slips the blank disc in another gaming box or packing!<br>
So now we have 2 games instead of 1 <br>
we were not the bad guys ,the shopkeeper was the real con! <br>
He charge everyone around Rs 200 for a pirated disc and that was way too much to pay for pirated games!<br>
And he used to Re-write games on those blank discs which we slip into his games!
with practice , over time we were bored of playing games !<br>
Our passion for games got washed up in a month !<br>
we've tried every single game !<br>
we used complete it and<strong> redistribute it for "FREE"</strong>.<br>
Just like RobinHood ! <br>
