title: Episode 6- VM and Dual Boots 
---
<strong>Virtual Machines,</strong> <br>
<em>
A virtual machine (VM) is an operating system OS or application environment that is installed on software which imitates dedicated hardware. The end user has the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on dedicated hardware.
</em> <br>

My introduction with Linux was on these virtual machines! <br>
installing virtual machines enables one to perform many tasks related to different operating systems on one machine by not changing its boot sector.<br>
i tried XP on it ,it worked like a charm,<br>VMware is my favourite VM player!<br>
Virtual Machines are best to try first,<br>
i learnt about os level by messing with System32 Files on virtual machines itself,
i learnt about command line and terminal interfaces on virtual machines, <br>
virtual machines are good for one who wants to experience something new,
I've experienced Linux , Windows , Android and even OSX  too !<br>

After grabbing the basics ,
I played to be a pro!<br>

I decided to dual boot my machine,
after 4-5 failed attempt and hardware crashes,
i learnt the process of dual booting Linux with partitioning sectors,<br>

After the successful installation of Linux,
I tried to customize my boot loader,<br>
And replaced <strong> GRUB </strong> with <strong> BURG </strong>!<br>
<em>
Burg is a brand-new boot loader based on GRUB. It uses a new object format which allows it to be built in a wider range of OS, including Linux/Windows/OSX/FreeBSD, etc. It also has a highly configurable menu system which works in both text and graphic mode. Additional features like stream support and multiple input/output devices are also planned.

Making dualboot beautiful by removing ugly but functional grub boot loader with beautiful and minimal Burg bootloader !<br>

After one successful try,i installed 3-4 Operating Systems at one time!<br>

I used Ubuntu as my primary os for 4 months straight, but then i moved back to windows because it is easy for everyone to operate !<br>
it was good with dualboot,
but i prefer to go with virtual machines first!!
<br>
But these regular processes of installing and crashing ,
molested my machine! 
Donâ€™t do this your machine 
go for virtual machines 
<br>
