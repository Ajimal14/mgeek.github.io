<strong >Episode 3 : Deep Web </strong><br>

After some time, I started with <strong>Internet surfing! </strong>
I used to have Internet limit of 300 mb at a time, when I literally started! 
My father paid bills over 1k he decided to go unlimited! <br>
Unlimited Broadband, a treasure for any child, 
I was introduced to the Internet in around 2005, 
I started with Google and Wikipedia first, I worked on some projects for my father, helped him in some official work, like searching for some rule or data.<br>
After Gripping hands on the stones I stepped on the Rocks, 
I started with downloading songs and then I started looking on documents on hacking over the Wikipedia. 
After some years, when I got myself in a little pace, 
I downloaded tor browser and started some what we say surfing over the tsunami! 
I studied about Anonymity, opens source and Hacktivists. <br>
While surfing onion websites I got some kind of access to a private server, I started looking up for it. 
I got some replies from the server, 
I got my pass to it! <em>
It was some kind of community which was supporting anonymous over Scientology thing,</em> I was just trained to use a software named LOIC [
Low orbit ion cannon] 
For the first and the last time I've done something exciting and hacking! 
But it was a community, we were not into the hacking stuff more <br>
It was a open certification and training community! It was in its early stage that time, 
That group was a phenomenal start for me! 
Only 5 members, we used some kind of Firefox plug-in to log into the server. <br>
We've done some projects together including a project for Muvizu 3d (animation software)  and one independent project for Bluestacks App Player. 
I've completed some tests and got my Microsoft Certification for Business Intelligence. 
We've completed some projects for 4Chan and Tor Community too. 
The Server was presented with Minimal GUI and a video chat room, we used to talk for hours! <br>
But then after some time, <br>
Our server was locked down and seized under some conditions, I guess mainly for scientology hack! 
So that was my journey to the Deep Web! 
Silkroad, Oh My, No Drugs here, pure and sober! 
Our Group was kinda against the fact of drugs on Silkroad, it was a great marketplace but drugs ruined it. Great idea but not for us! 
Pornographic addiction is enough for me,! 
No need of drugs! <br>
Start Your Journey, Download Tor Browser and start using open source projects! 
It's seems like unreal but you'll find your destination too, I am done with it! Learnt alot from the community,! <br>
What I've learnt, <br>
<em>1.Open Source <br>
2.Onion Routing <br>
3.Teamwork<br> 
4.Industry Experience<br> 
5.Secure Shell and Servers </em> <br>
